# In playbook we have created differnt play,tasks,handlers,variables and because of this the playbook becomes lenghty.
# To avoid this we will create some roles and by using these roles will create playbook.

To create role we will use ansible-galaxy which is nothing but a galaxy website where users can share roles and to a command-line tool for installing, creating, and managing roles.
1. We will create ansible role 
     ansible-galaxy init role_1
2. Now one directory will be created to check this use tree command
3. The role will consists of some files.
     - default
     - files    → This directory will conssts of the files which are copied/moved to server
     - handlers → Will consists of all tasks 
     - meta     → Data of data     
     - tasks    → Will consists of all tasks 
     - templets → These are simple commands for this will use jinja language.     ----(https://youtu.be/6cjbnuKjqPM) See this
     - tests →
     - vars → Will consists of all variables
     
  Now write all your tasks,variables and handlers other things in proper files.
  To include this role in playbook use 
     vi playbook.yml
