Vault is a place where we can store our personal data.
In caseof this we have several files and in these files we are using some private data like access_key, passwords which we don't want to show user's without permission.
For this in ansible we use ansible-valut

1. To create a new vault file
    ansible-valut create file_1.yml    -- It will ask password give and remember that.
    
2. To see/edit this file
     ansible-valut edit file_1.yml      -- Now provide the password it will open
     
3. To change the password
      ansible-valut rekey file_1.yml     -- Give old and new password
      
4. To create a vault file from existing file
       ansible-valut encrypt file_2.yml    -- file_2 must be there in this directory
       
5. To remove vault from any file 
        ansible-valut decrypt file_2.yml
